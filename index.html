                <p>I think you have to trust an organization instead of trust one person. Also the kid him self can find alot of friends and it has a lot of benefit to send your kid to a public daycare with many managers and educators and a lot of parents to come and go, then you know that there are alot of eyes watching your child and can leave him there with peace of mind.</p>
